# Ai writer

google api was free so I played around with something to write novels. it reminded me of things I would like to read as a kid. 

after playing around with it I think creative writing is a really interesting task to imporve AIs on. accuracy isn't verifiable so I leaned towards AI graders performing pairwise comparisons. I also came to think of the task as function composition using natural language. I think its a fun project for anyone and I also think the new gemini models could do pretty well with a similar system right now.
