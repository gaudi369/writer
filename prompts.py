            You are tasked with generating a new outline for your next arc. Each arc should contribute to the protagonist's growth in skill, power, and narrative depth.
            Your story should have {desired_arcs} arcs in total. Arc {desired_arcs} must conclude the story.
            The number of chapters and the main events in the arc should vary based on narrative needs.
            The structure must follow a clear beginning, middle, and end, ensuring escalation, progression, and resolution.
            Each chapter in the arc must be actively progressing the story. 

            REQUIREMENTS

            * In each arc the main character must grow 1 full rank in cultivation. (half-step and breakthrough).

            * There must be at least 2 chapters tagged Power Up per arc.
            * If the story is finished simply return the word "Finished" and we can revise (must be precisely the word Finished)

            The arc should include:
            Inciting Incident: The event that disrupts the hero's status quo and sets the arc in motion.
            Early Challenges: Introduce minor obstacles that highlight the setting, power system, and potential allies.
            Progression Milestones: Points where the hero trains, discovers, or acquires something that directly contributes to their power or ability to confront the antagonist.

    # Initial Planning
    setting_prompt = f'''

            Your task: Use this streamlined formula to design an engaging progression-fantasy setting centered in a cultivation world.

            The world should mix classic cultivation tropes like cultivation ranks and ancient sects with fresh tropes from shounen manga and western fantasy.

            Aim for something unique that celebrates tropes but is still creative.

            For example, introducing shounen adventure quests or power up transformations. Or including western fantasy epic monsters or magical academies.

            This setting should be sized to be exlpored in the length of a novella.

            Craft a setting appealing to young male readers aged 15-25, while focusing on the elements of the formula below.

            FORMULA FOR DESIGNING A CULTIVATION-WORLD SETTING

            Core Concept & Conflict
            Establish the main tension shaping your cultivation world. (e.g., a dark cultivator has fallen and sects are struggling to occupy the power gap, sects competing for dominance over a newly discovered spirit-rich continent, a celestial war is spilling into the mortal plane). Focus on how these conflicts impact individuals and the broader system, creating both personal struggles and world-spanning challenges.

            Geography & Environment
            Design a world that is distinct and memorable (e.g., tiered mountain ranges brimming with rare resources, high seas with powerful wandering spirits, fragmented heavens with divine remnants crashing to earth) the geography should shape the cultivation system and daily life. Dangerous environments might provide breakthroughs in power, while trade, survival, and travel must adapt to unique hazards or opportunities.

            Societal Structures
            Outline how power and authority are organized. Sects, clans, and factions vie for influence, with names and identities that make them stand out (e.g., Scarlet Lotus Sect, Iron Void Hall). Social hierarchies tied to cultivation levels (mortals, initiates, grandmasters) create built-in tension. Explore how these structures generate conflict. Perhaps lower disciples are treated as disposable or failure in a breakthrough leads to public disgrace.

            Magic System (Cultivation)
            Develop a structured cultivation system that blends familiar elements with creative twists. What powers cultivation? (e.g., absorbing celestial essence, forging contracts with martial spirits, intense physical excersize under magical gravity). The system should be internally consistent to its own rules.

            Power Tiers
            Define {desired_arcs} martial ranks (e.g., Qi Foundation, Golden Core Ascendant, Nascent Soul) with a creative theme. Each rank should be earned by achieving a unique internal breakthrough which makes something new possible. Each rank is seperated by a single 'half-step' sub-division before breakthrough. To clarify: half-step rank 1, rank 1 breakthrough, half-step rank 2, rank 2 breakthrough, ... , half-step rank {desired_arcs}, and finally rank {desired_arcs} breakthrough. There are no further ranks.

            Power Progression
            There is always a quantitative measure of breakthrough (e.g., lifting a 500 catty stone, forming a 5-centimeter radius golden internal core, manifesting 1-33 tribulation clouds). It is very important to note what the specific measure (criteria) is for each rank. Be creative.

            Secret (of the World)
            Introduce a hidden truth that could destabilize the world. (e.g., martial scriptures stolen from an ancient deity, there a conspiracy restricting who can truly ascend) Connect this secret to the protagonist's personal journey. (e.g., they discover a forbidden art tied to the secret, they forced to oppose the system and its rulers)

            Story Ending
            Plan a conclusion to the main tension which involves the secret of the world. This should end the story without implying or requiring any further narrative development.

            Your task: Use this streamlined formula to design an engaging main character and power fantasy arc.

            Your story is driven by our main character transforming from ordinary to the martial peak. He must explore the world and progress through the power system.

            Your readers are incredibly invested in this progression so we must plan it out. Understand that this fantasy will be fully achieved in {desired_arcs} arcs (around {(desired_arcs*20)-10} chapters).

            Craft an essential fantasy for the story which appeals to young male readers aged 15-25. Use the formula below.

            FORMULA FOR DESIGNING THE ESSENTIAL FANTASY

            Main Character
            Origin & Upbringing
            Give the hero a distinct upbringing or hardship that molds them. (e.g., Raised in a hidden valley by a powerless sect? Descendant of outcast warriors?) Name them. They are a 15 year old boy.

            Motivation & Goals
            State a clear driving goal or desire (e.g., to master an art, avenge a loss, find a missing parent).

            Flaws & Challenges
            Choose two or three flaws that could hamper progression (e.g., impulsiveness, stubborn pride, social awkwardness).

            Mastering the World
            Outline key places to explore, treasures to discover, and history to learn. Focus on major milestones but allow for flexibility in the details.

            Mastering the Power System. List these extensively and in detail based on the setting. They should be relevant to the character.
            What tiers of power must they reach? (all of them) What must they learn to accomplish at each breakthrough?

            Mastering the Power System Part 2. Commit to the style and theme of the main character's powers, but leave room for the details to emerge during the writing process. Prioritze coolness, uniqueness, and synergy.
            What cultivation method do they use (only 1)? What {desired_arcs} named techniques must they use? What martial skills must they learn? What equipment and weapons must they use?

            Internal Growth. Focus on major milestones but allow for flexibility in the details.
            Plan for the main character's psychological and emotional development. What internal struggles will they face, and how will these shape their journey?

            Arc Outline 
            Plan the milestones over {desired_arcs} arcs. Enumerate the arcs (1 to {desired_arcs}) and list the milestones for each one. Restate the ending clearly.

            Your Mission
            Use this formula to craft a detailed and compelling main character and essential fantasy. Follow the formula directly as written.

            Your task: Outline the plot for the first arc of a long-running series using my Progression Fantasy Plot Outline Generator.

            This arc can stand on its own (with its own villain, setting, and side-cast) yet still build toward a larger overarching narrative.

            You are writing a progression fantasy. It is serial fiction where the hero steadily advances in skill, power, and reputation.

            It borrows from the classic Hero's Journey while incorporating progression fantasy hallmarks: training arcs, stong enemies, magical power systems, and repeated cycles of growth and challenge.
